This is a personal protfolio page made with NextJS that has the following layout:

## How I designed the website
The core desing of the page was to be extremely simple but demonstrate the projects I was working at the time, however it assisted with laying out the foundation for my actual protfolio page which is my personal blog page.

This page is meant to display the start of working with NextJS, this webpage had a majority of its components based on the default page which made it look extremely bland. However thanks this project iw as able to take various aspects of it including the dashboard and use it in my actual [portfolio page](https://github.com/DebuggingaHopper/lakebyte)
